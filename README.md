# A-3D-NoC-DSE
Models for design space exploration of asymmetric 3D NoCs

## Introduction
The design space exploration of 3D NoCs with asymmetry is rather challenging due to the technology heterogeneity present. An optimization of the interconnect design is an open research topic. Here, possible solutions are proposed. 

## mixed integer linear programming 
A mixed integer linear program for the design space exploration is saved. It covers several sub problems and even comprises the popular dimension ordered routing. The description of the formulae as such will be published soon. 
We use CPLEX as optimizer, which offers academic licenses.
